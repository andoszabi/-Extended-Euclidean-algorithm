# -Extended-Euclidean-algorithm
The standard and the extended Euclidean algorithm implemented in go
.
The standard Euclidean algorithm finds the greatest common divisor of two integers.
If n and m are integers, and g is their greatest common divisor, then we know that there exist integers x and y such that n * x + m * y = g. The extended Euclidean algorithm find not just g, but also x and y.
